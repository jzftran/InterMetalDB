## About

InterMetalDB is a database of metal ions bound at macromolecular interface.
The records in the database are based on the structures deposited in the RCSB PDB.


InterMetalDB was made as part of my PhD.

To learn more about the intermolecular binding of the Zn(II) ion by proteins read our paper: A. Kocyła, J. B. Tran, and A. Krężel, “Galvanization of Protein–Protein Interactions in a Dynamic Zinc Interactome,” Trends Biochem. Sci., vol. xx, no. xx, pp. 1–16, Sep. 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2020.08.011
